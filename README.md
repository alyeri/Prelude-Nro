# Prelude

**Prelude** is the Nintendo Switch homebrew that switches your console between the
[Nextendo Network](https://nextendo.network) and Nintendo's official servers.

It is a small `.nro` you run from the homebrew menu. You pick a mode, it applies the change and
reboots. Nothing is permanent — you can switch back whenever you want.

```
        Which network do you want to load?
        [ NEXTENDO ]     [ NINTENDO ]
```

- **Nextendo mode** — redirects Nintendo traffic to the Nextendo servers and provisions everything
  the console needs to trust them.
- **Nintendo mode** — removes every component Prelude installed and hands the console back to
  Nintendo, with Atmosphère's own telemetry blocking restored.

## How it works

Prelude writes configuration that Atmosphère understands and includes narrowly scoped game patches
where a title bypasses the system SSL service. It does not replace or intercept the network stack:

| What | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Host redirections | `/atmosphere/hosts/{sysmmc,emummc}.txt` (Atmosphère DNS.mitm) |
| DNS.mitm on/off | `/atmosphere/config/system_settings.ini` |
| PRODINFO per mode | `/exosphere.ini` (emuMMC only) |
| Certificate trust | `exefs_patches/`, `nro_patches/`, browser CA bundle |
| Splatoon 3 certificate result | Title-specific Skyline loader and fail-closed runtime plugin |

Because it only writes files Atmosphère reads at boot, everything it does is reversible by
switching modes — or by deleting those files by hand.

### Splatoon 3 diagnostics

The Splatoon 3 runtime patch writes its loader and plugin status to
`/atmosphere/contents/0100C2500FC20000/s3certbypass.log`. If this file is absent after launching
the game, the Skyline loader did not initialize. A present log distinguishes a successful patch,
an already-patched instruction, a missing signature, and an ambiguous signature. The package does
not include clock/overclock plugins.

## Building

There is no local toolchain requirement beyond Docker:

```sh
docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/work" -w /work devkitpro/devkita64 \
  bash -c 'dkp-pacman -Syu --noconfirm switch-freetype switch-sdl2 switch-sdl2_mixer switch-mpg123 && make -j$(nproc)'
```

The result is `nextendo.nro`. Copy it to `/switch/` on your SD card.

Version numbers are kept in lockstep: `APP_VERSION` in the `Makefile` is `1.0.N`, where `N` is
`NEXTENDO_BUILD` in `source/nextendo_update.h`, and the GitHub tag is `vN`.

## Status

**Prelude is not actively maintained right now.** It is published here so anyone can read it, build
it, fork it, or run their own network with it. Issues and pull requests may go unanswered.

If you are running your own server, the addresses Prelude redirects to live in
`source/nextendo_hosts.h` — that file is the whole configuration surface.
